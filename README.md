## Introduction

The warehouse management application that allows owners to rent out space from their homes or warehouses to multiple clients is considered a significant advancement in the field of inventory and warehouse management. This type of application provides innovative opportunities for individuals and small businesses to make use of vacant spaces and generate additional income.

This application makes it easy for owners to efficiently and seamlessly offer space rental services. They can specify available space sizes, types, and prices. On the other hand, clients can search for suitable spaces and rent them to meet their storage or business operation needs.

Thanks to this application, users can benefit from online reservation technology and a secure payment system to facilitate booking and rental processes. This model of applications opens up new opportunities to generate income and effectively utilize empty spaces, making it an attractive option for those seeking a flexible and economical solution for managing and deriving value from their private spaces.
